# Decompiling

## How the build knows what is decompiled

[dsd](https://github.com/AetiasHax/ds-decomp) cuts each module of the ROM into object files, as its `delinks.txt`
says. A module is the main program, an autoload or an overlay, and its config is under `config/jpn_rev1/arm9/`:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `delinks.txt` | The module's sections, then each source file and the address ranges that are its own |
| `symbols.txt` | The name, kind and address of every function and variable |
| `relocs.txt` | Every place that holds an address, and what it points at |

What no source file claims is delinked as the module's "gap", and linked back as it was. So the ROM always builds,
however little is decompiled, and a source file takes over a range of addresses by claiming it.

## Adding a source file

Overlay 0 is the worked example: `src/overlays/ov000/ov000.cpp`, claimed at the end of
`config/jpn_rev1/arm9/overlays/ov000/delinks.txt`.

1. Read the code. `ninja dis` writes a listing of every module to `build/jpn_rev1/asm/`.
2. Find where the file begins and ends. A file's functions are contiguous in `.text`, and its data is contiguous in
   each of the other sections, in the same order as the files around it.
3. Claim the ranges in the module's `delinks.txt`:
   ```
   src/overlays/ov000/ov000.cpp:
       .text       start:0x02149a40 end:0x02149c50
       .data       start:0x02149c60 end:0x02149ca0
   ```
4. Write the file, run `python3 configure.py` so that the build knows of it, and `ninja`.
5. Open the repository in [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) and pick the file. objdiff rebuilds it as
   you save, and shows each function beside the original.

A function of the original and yours are compared when they have the same name. A function that is not understood yet
keeps the name dsd gave it, such as `func_ov000_02149c10`, declared `extern "C"` so that the compiler leaves the name
alone. Once it is understood, give it its real name in the source, and the mangled form of that name in
`symbols.txt`.

## Finishing a file

When every function and all the data of a file match, mark it `complete` in `delinks.txt`:

```
src/overlays/ov000/ov000.cpp:
    complete
    .text       start:0x02149a40 end:0x02149c50
    .data       start:0x02149c60 end:0x02149ca0
```

From then on the ROM is linked from your object instead of the original's bytes, and `ninja` fails if the module no
longer matches. Until then the file is compiled and compared, and does not go into the ROM.

## Naming symbols as you go

`symbols.txt` is the project's record of what each address is, and the name is the documentation. So a name goes in
the moment the code shows what a thing is, whether or not the function is decompiled, and never waits for the file to
be finished:

- Rename the symbol in the module's `symbols.txt`, and nothing else: relocations refer to addresses, not names.
- For a library function, use the library's own name (`DC_FlushRange`). For C++ game code, the name in `symbols.txt` is
  the mangled one, since that is what the compiler emits.
- Say in the commit message what the evidence was. "Named the cache functions of os_cache.c: each is identified by
  the CP15 operation it performs" lets the next person trust the name, or check it.
- What is not understood keeps the name dsd gave it: `func_<address>`, `data_<address>`, and `unk_<offset>` for a
  field. A guessed name reads as knowledge, and is worse than none.
- `dsd sig apply --all` names the functions dsd has signatures for. Run it again when dsd is updated.

## Subdividing units

A module starts as one unit, its gap. Cut a file out of it as soon as the file's bounds are known, before any of its
code is written: add it to `delinks.txt` under the path its source will have. dsd then delinks it as a unit of its own,
and the gap shrinks to what is still unassigned.

```
lib/NitroSDK/os/os_cache.c:
    .text       start:0x02007ff4 end:0x02008114
```

That unit appears on the progress map under its own name and counts toward its category, so the map shows how much
of the game is understood as well as how much is matched. Which directory a file goes in says what it is:

| Directory | For | Category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/` | The game's own code, by overlay or by subsystem | Game |
| `lib/<library>/` | Code of the SDK and of middleware, under the library's own file names where known | Libraries |

Cut where the evidence is: a library's known file, a run of functions that only refer to each other and to their own
data, a static initializer (each belongs to one file), a table of virtual functions. Do not cut on a guess: a wrong
boundary makes two files that can never match, and costs more than a large gap does.

## Conventions

- **Source files are UTF-8.** The compiler receives them as Shift JIS, so Japanese text in a string literal is written
  as it is, not as escapes.
- **The game is C++** (see [binary.md](binary.md)), so the aim for game code is the classes it was written as. Plain
  functions that take the object, as in overlay 0 today, are a first step for code whose class is not recovered yet.
- **Never commit anything taken from the ROM**: no assembly, no data dumps, no assets. The configs under `config/`
  hold addresses and names only.

## Where to start

The order that the code itself suggests:

1. **Map the libraries in the main program.** Much of it is NitroSDK, NitroSystem and middleware, for which names and
   often source are known. Naming those functions makes all the code that calls them readable, and cutting them into
   units under `lib/` draws the line between library and game. `lib/NitroSDK/os/os_cache.c` is the first.
2. **Recover the classes that every scene is built from.** Each overlay holds classes that derive from ones in the
   main program, so little of an overlay can be finished before its base classes are.
3. **Then the overlays**, smallest first: each is a self-contained piece of the game and a short path to a complete
   file.
